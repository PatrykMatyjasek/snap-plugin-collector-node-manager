## Contributing Code
**_IMPORTANT_**: We encourage contributions to the project from the community. We ask that you keep the following guidelines in mind when planning your contribution.

* Whether your contribution is for a bug fix or a feature request, **create an [Issue](https://github.com/PatrykMatyjasek/snap-plugin-collector-node-manager/issues)** and let us know what you are thinking.
* **For bugs**, if you have already found a fix, feel free to submit a Pull Request referencing the Issue you created. Include the `Fixes #` syntax to link it to the issue you're addressing.
* **For feature requests**, we want to improve upon the library incrementally which means small changes at a time. In order to ensure your PR can be reviewed in a timely manner, please keep PRs small, e.g. <10 files and <500 lines changed. If you think this is unrealistic, then mention that within the issue and we can discuss it.

Once you're ready to contribute code back to this repo, start with these steps:

* Fork the appropriate sub-projects that are affected by your change.
* Clone the fork to `$GOPATH/src/github.com/intelsdi-x/`:
  ```
  $ cd "${GOPATH}/src/github.com/PatrykMatyjasek"
  $ git clone https://github.com/PatrykMatyjasek/snap-plugin-collector-node-manager.git
  ```
* Create a topic branch for your change and checkout that branch:
  ```
  $ git checkout -b some-topic-branch
  ```
* Make your changes to the code and add tests to cover contributed code.
* Validate the changes and run the test suite if one is provided.
* Commit your changes and push them to your fork.
* Open a pull request for the appropriate project.
* Contributors will review your pull request, suggest changes, and merge it when itâ€™s ready and/or offer feedback.
